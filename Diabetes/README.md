“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.” To find that logic is called “machine learning”.\
**Tom  Mitchell**

##### Types of Machine learning Algorithms
1- *Supervised Learning*: Input data(training data) and has a  label or result . ex: Spam/not-spam  (stock price)\
2- *Unsupervised Learning*: Input data is not labeled and does not have a known result. ex: Grouping students  by marks\
3- *Semi-Supervised Learning*: Input data is a mixture of labeled and unlabeled examples. ex: a photo archive where only some of the images are labeled, (e.g. dog, cat, person) and the majority are unlabeled.\
4- *Reinforcement Learning*: A goal-oriented learning based on interaction with environment. Autonomous cars.

  
###### Supervised Machine Learning
- Regression: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
- Instance-based Algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Decision Tree Algorithms: CART
- Bayesian Algorithms: Naive Bayes
- Ensemble Algorithms: eXtreme Gradient Boosting
- Deep Learning Algorithms: Convolution Neural Network

###### Classification vs Regression
Classification predicting a label 
Regression predicting a quantity.

###### Classification Algorithms Examples:
Linear: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
Nonlinear: Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors
Ensemble:
Bagging: Random Forest
Boosting: AdaBoost
Machine Learning Pipeline:
Define Problem

###### The 4 C's of Data Cleaning: Correcting, Completing, Creating, and Converting
- Correcting abnormal values and outliers  (age = 800 instead of 80)
- Completing missing information  (null) use  mean, median
- Creating new features for analysis  ( use existing features to create new features)
- Converting fields to the correct format for calculations
